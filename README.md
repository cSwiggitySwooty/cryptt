# encryption-algorithm
An encryption/decryption algorithm created by using irrational functions on integers and then using the key as a cipher.

It uses trig, square roots, and other functions that make it so the key cannot reliably recreated.

Encrypt.jar and Decrypt.jar both take three inputs. The first one is the password that is hashed into a key. The second one is the location of the file. The third input is the location/name of the file in the file system that you wish to create.
