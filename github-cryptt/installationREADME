To install, run the following:
 - sudo chmod +x install
 -sudo ./install

After this is done, it would be advised to make a test file and encrypt and decrypt it using the following commands.
 - First, navigate to somewhere that isn't cluttered.
 - nano fileOG #Enter any text you want to in this file
 - cryptt -e testingKey fileOG fileEC
 - cryptt -d testingKey fileEC fileDC
 - cat fileDC

The two files (fileOG and fileDC) should be identical. If they are, cryptt is correctly installed.
